   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   The script will simulate the initiation and activation of a system, followed by the launch of a machine. You will see progress updates and a progress bar indicating the completion of each task.

## Customization

- You can modify the text and sleep durations in the script to suit your needs. Adjust the delays in `time.sleep()` to change the duration of each stage.
